# graph_generator_3d
An library to easly generate 3d graphs using jzy3d

The intention here is just provide a class Java that already have the Scatter graph for jzy3d configured.

Initially, just Scatter with 3 dimensions is ready to use. Helps to improve is well received! :-)

With just 2 classes. You can configure everthing. I hope the javadocs are clear.
